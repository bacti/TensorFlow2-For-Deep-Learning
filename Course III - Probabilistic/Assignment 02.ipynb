This distribution has a density that is the weighted sum of two normally distributed ones: one with a standard deviation of 1 and one with a standard deviation of 10. In this way, it has a sharp spike around 0 (from the normal distribution with standard deviation 1), but is also more spread out towards far away values (from the contribution from the normal distribution with standard deviation 10). The reason for using such a prior is that it is like a standard unit normal, but makes values far away from 0 more likely, allowing the model to explore a larger weight space.
